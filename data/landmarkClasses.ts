It houses the offices of Advancement and Alumni Relations and Technology Transfer and Corporate Partnerships, as well as other administrative offices and study spaces.\n\nThe building was named Caltech Hall in 2021. It was previously known as the Robert A. Millikan Memorial Library, named after Robert Andrews Millikan, director of the Norman Bridge Laboratory of Physics and chair of the Executive Council of the Institute from 1921 to 1945. The building was made possible by a gift from Seeley G. Mudd.\n\nCaltech's Board of Trustees authorized the renaming following a unanimous recommendation by a committee charged to study Millikan and his affiliation with the eugenics movement.",

        description: "The Fleming Cannon is a Caltech landmark and Franco-Prussian war era weapon circa 1870. It is operated by Fleming Hovse and is fired to mark important events such as the end of rotation, the annual student Ditch Day, the end of a term, and graduation.\n\n The cannon was originally used in the Franco-Prussian War. It would eventually live as a front lawn artifact between 1925 and 1972 outside the then-military themed Southwestern Academy in San Marino. Fleming class officers got permission from Southwestern to take the cannon. \n\n In 2006, a group of MIT Students stole the Fleming Cannon and transported it all the way to Cambridge, Massachusetts as a prank. \n\n Source: https://www.pasadenanow.com/main/caltechs-famed-and-once-hijacked-war-cannon-to-thunder-at-commencement-ceremony",
